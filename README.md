# AmbuLink

The AmbuLink project addresses
inefficiencies in emergency medical services
(EMS) in the Philippines, including lack of
real-time hospital bed availability, suboptimal
routing, and delays in ambulance-to-hospital
communication. By integrating features such as
real-time hospital bed updates, intelligent routing
via GPS, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
for voice-activated hospital searches, AmbuLink
aims to streamline EMS processes. The system
was developed using an evolutionary prototyping
methodology, involving stakeholders like
paramedics and emergency room staff to refine
functionality. Evaluation demonstrated significant
improvements in hospital preparation, ambulance
routing, and overall patient handover efficiency,
setting a new standard for EMS operations.
